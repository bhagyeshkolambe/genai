**Encoder-Decoder Structure in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**

1. **What is a Variational Autoencoder?**
   - A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of generative model that uses an encoder to map input data into a latent space and a decoder to reconstruct the original data from this latent representation.

2. **Why are VAEs considered generative models?**
   - VAEs are considered generative because they learn to generate new samples by sampling points in the latent space and decoding them back into the original data space.

3. **What is the role of the encoder in a VAE?**
   - The encoder's role is to map input data X to its probability distribution q(z|X) over the latent variables z, typically represented as a mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).

4. **What does the decoder do in a VAE?**
   - The decoder maps the sampled latent variable z back to the original input space, aiming to reconstruct the input data X.

5. **How is the loss function defined in a VAE?**
   - The loss function in a VAE consists of two parts: the reconstruction error and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the learned distribution q(z|X) and the prior p(z).

6. **What is the purpose of KL divergence in the loss function?**
   - KL divergence ensures that the learned latent space is close to a standard normal distribution, promoting stability during training.

7. **Why is VAE training non-convex?**
   - VAE training is non-convex due to the presence of both reconstruction error (which can be convex) and KL divergence terms (which are not guaranteed to be convex).

8. **What is meant by "learned latent space"?**
   - A learned latent space refers to the lower-dimensional representation that captures the essence of the input data, created by the encoder.

9. **How does sampling from the encoder's output contribute to generating new samples?**
   - Sampling from q(z|X) allows for exploration in the latent space and generation of diverse outputs when combined with the decoder.

10. **What is meant by "reparameterization trick"?**
    - The reparameterization trick is a technique used in VAEs to make optimization over stochastic variables more tractable, enabling gradient-based learning through backpropagation.
